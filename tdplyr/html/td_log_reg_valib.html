<h2>Logistic Regression</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Logistic Regression is one of the most widely used types of statistical analysis.
In Logistic Regression, a set of independent variables (in this case, columns) is
processed to predict the value of a dependent variable (column) that assumes two
values referred to as response (1) and non-response (0). The user can specify which
value of the dependent variable to treat as the response, and all other values
assumed by the dependent variable are treated as non-repsonse. The result is not,
however, a continuous numeric variable as seen in Linear Regression, but rather a
probability between 0 and 1 that the response value is assumed by the dependent
variable.<br />
<br />
There are many types of analysis that lend themselves to the use of Logistic Regression,
and when scoring a model, benefit from the estimation of a probability rather than
a fixed value. For example, when predicting who should be targeted for a marketing
campaign, the scored customers can be ordered by the predicted probability from most
to least likely, and the top n values taken from the customer list.<br />
Some of the key features of Logistic Regression are outlined below.
</p>

<ol>
<li><p> The Teradata table operator CALCMATRIX is used to build an ESSCP matrix for
purposes of validating the input data, such as by checking for constant values.
Also, to avoid rebuilding this matrix every time the algorithm is run, the
user may run the Matrix Analysis separately, saving an ESSCP matrix in a
tbl_teradata that can then be input to Logistic Regression. Refer &quot;matrix.data&quot;
argument.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> One or more group by columns can optionally be specified so that an input
matrix is built for each combination of group by column values, and subsequently
a separate Logistic Regression model is built for each matrix. To achieve this,
the names of the group by columns are passed to CALCMATRIX as parameters, so it
includes them as columns in the matrix data it creates. Refer &quot;group.columns&quot;
argument.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The stepwise feature for Logistic Regression is a technique for selecting the
independent variables in a logistic model. It consists of different methods of
'trying' variables and adding or removing them from a model through a series of
forward and backward steps described in the parameter section.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> A Statistics data is available, displaying the mean and standard deviation of
each model variable. Refer to the &quot;stats.output&quot; argument.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> A Success data is available, displaying counts of predicted versus actual values
of the dependent variable in the logistic model.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> A Multi-Threshold Success Table is available. Refer &quot;threshold.output&quot; argument.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> A Lift Table, such as would be used to build a Lift Chart, is available.
Refer &quot;lift.output&quot; argument.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> A Near Dependency Report is available to identify two or more columns that may
be collinear.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The algorithm is partially scalable because the size of each input matrix depends
only on the number of independent variables (columns) and not on the size of the
input data. The calculations performed on the client workstation however are not
scalable when group by columns are used, because each model is built serially
based on each matrix in the matrix data.

<h3>Other Arguments</h3>



<h4>backward</h4>

<p>Optional Argument.<br />
Specifies whether to take backward steps or not. Backward steps, 
i.e., removing variables from a model, use the P-value of the 
T-statistic, i.e., the ratio of a B-coefficient to its standard 
error. The variable (column) with the largest P-value is removed 
if the P-value exceeds the criterion to remove.<br />
Types: logical
</p>



<h4>backward.only</h4>

<p>Optional Argument.<br />
Specifies whether to use only backward technique or not. This 
technique is similar to the backward technique, except that a 
forward step is not performed. It starts with all independent 
variables in the model. Backward steps are executed until no 
more are possible.<br />
Types: logical
</p>



<h4>exclude.columns</h4>

<p>Optional Argument.<br />
Specifies the name(s) of the column(s) to exclude from the
analysis, if a column specifier such as 'all', 'allnumeric'
is used in the &quot;columns&quot; argument. By default, when the 
&quot;exclude.columns&quot; argument is used, dependent variable and 
group by columns, if any, are automatically excluded as 
input columns and do not need to be included as 
&quot;exclude.columns&quot;.<br />
Types: character OR vector of Strings (character)
</p>



<h4>cond.ind.threshold</h4>

<p>Optional Argument.<br />
Specifies the condition index threshold value to use 
while generating near dependency report. This is used 
when &quot;near.dep.report&quot; is set to TRUE.<br />
Default Value: 30<br />
Types: integer
</p>



<h4>constant</h4>

<p>Optional Argument.<br />
Specifies whether the logistic model includes a constant term 
or not. When set to TRUE, model includes a constant term.<br />
Default Value: TRUE<br />
Types: logical
</p>



<h4>convergence</h4>

<p>Optional Argument.<br />
Specifies the convergence criterion such that the algorithm 
stops iterating when the change in log likelihood function 
falls below this value.<br />
Default Value: 0.001<br />
Types: numeric
</p>



<h4>entrance.criterion</h4>

<p>Optional Argument.<br />
Specifies the criterion to enter a variable into the model. 
The W-statistic chi-square P-value must be less than this 
value for a variable to be added.<br />
Default Value: 0.05<br />
Types: numeric
</p>



<h4>forward</h4>

<p>Optional Argument.<br />
Specifies whether to use forward technique or not. When set to TRUE, 
in this technique, starting with no independent variables in the model, 
a forward step is performed, adding the &quot;best&quot; choice, followed by a 
backward step, removing the worst choice. Refer to the &quot;stepwise&quot; 
argument for a description of the steps in this technique.<br />
Types: logical
</p>



<h4>forward.only</h4>

<p>Optional Argument.<br />
Specifies whether to use only forward technique or not. This 
technique is similar to the forward technique, except that a 
backward step is not performed.<br />
Types: logical
</p>



<h4>group.columns</h4>

<p>Optional Argument.<br />
Specifies the name(s) of the column(s) dividing the input into 
partitions, one for each combination of values in the group by 
columns. For each partition or combination of values a separate 
logistic model and XML report is built.<br />
Types: character OR vector of Strings (character)
</p>



<h4>lift.output</h4>

<p>Optional Argument.<br />
Specifies whether to build a lift chart or not and add it in the 
functions output string. It splits up the computed probability 
values into deciles with the usual counts and percentages to 
demonstrate what happens when more and more rows of ordered 
probabilities are accumulated.<br />
Types: logical
</p>



<h4>matrix.data</h4>

<p>Optional Argument.<br />
Specifies the input matrix data to use for the analysis. Instead 
of internally building a matrix with the <code>td_matrix_valib()</code> each 
time this analysis is performed, the user may build an ESSCP Matrix 
once with the Matrix Analysis using <code>td_matrix_valib()</code>. The matrix 
can subsequently be read from this data instead of re-building it 
each time. If this is specified, the columns specified with the 
&quot;columns&quot; argument should be a subset of the columns in this matrix 
and can be specified in any order. The columns must however all be 
present in the matrix. Further, if group by columns are specified 
in the matrix, these same group by columns must be specified in 
this analysis.<br />
Types: tbl_teradata
</p>



<h4>max.iter</h4>

<p>Optional Argument.<br />
Specifies the maximum number of attempts to converge on a solution.<br />
Default Value: 100<br />
Types: integer
</p>



<h4>mem.size</h4>

<p>Optional Argument.<br />
Specifies the memory size in megabytes to allocate for in-memory 
Logistic Regression. If there is too much data to fit in this amount 
of memory or is set to 0 or argument is not specified, normal SQL 
processing is performed.<br />
Types: integer
</p>



<h4>near.dep.report</h4>

<p>Optional Argument.<br />
Specifies whether to produce an XML report showing columns 
that may be collinear as part of the output or not. The report 
is included in the XML output only if collinearity is detected.<br />
Two threshold arguments are available for this report, 
&quot;cond.ind.threshold&quot; and &quot;variance.prop.threshold&quot;.<br />
Types: logical
</p>



<h4>remove.criterion</h4>

<p>Optional Argument.<br />
Specifies the criterion to remove a variable from the model. 
The T-Statistic P-value must be greater than this value for a 
variable to be removed.<br />
Default Value: 0.05<br />
Types: numeric
</p>



<h4>response.value</h4>

<p>Optional Argument.<br />
Specifies the value assumed by the dependent column that is to 
be treated as the response value.<br />
Types: character
</p>



<h4>sample</h4>

<p>Optional Argument.<br />
Specifies whether to use sample of the data to be read into memory for 
processing, if the memory size available is less than the amount of 
data to process. When set to TRUE, a sample of data is read.<br />
Types: logical
</p>



<h4>stats.output</h4>

<p>Optional Argument.<br />
Specifies whether an optional data quality report should be 
delivered in the function's XML output string or not, which 
includes the mean and standard deviation of each model variable, 
derived from an ESSCP matrix.<br />
Default Value: FALSE<br />
Types: logical
</p>



<h4>stepwise</h4>

<p>Optional Argument.<br />
Specifies whether to perform a stepwise procedure or not.<br />
Forward steps, i.e., adding variables to a model, add the variable 
with the smallest chi-square P-value connected to its special 
W-statistic, provided the P-value is less than the criterion to 
enter.<br />
Backward steps, i.e., removing variables from a model, use the 
P-value of the T-statistic, i.e., the ratio of a B-coefficient to 
its standard error. The variable (column) with the largest P-value 
is removed if the P-value exceeds the criterion to remove.<br />
Default Value: FALSE<br />
Types: logical
</p>



<h4>success.output</h4>

<p>Optional Argument.<br />
Specifies whether an optional success report should be delivered 
in the function's XML output string or not, which includes the 
displaying counts of predicted versus actual values of the 
dependent variable of the logistic regression model. This report 
is similar to the Decision Tree Confusion Matrix, but the success 
report only includes two values of the dependent variable, namely
response versus non-response.<br />
Default Value: FALSE<br />
Types: logical
</p>



<h4>start.threshold</h4>

<p>Optional Argument.<br />
Specifies the beginning threshold value utilized in the 
Multi-Threshold Success output.<br />
Types: numeric
</p>



<h4>end.threshold</h4>

<p>Optional Argument.<br />
Specifies the ending threshold value utilized in the 
Multi-Threshold Success output.<br />
Types: numeric
</p>



<h4>increment.threshold</h4>

<p>Optional Argument.<br />
Specifies the difference in threshold values between 
adjacent rows in the Multi-Threshold Success output.<br />
Types: numeric
</p>



<h4>threshold.output</h4>

<p>Optional Argument.<br />
Specifies whether the Multi-Threshold Success output should 
be produced or not and included in the XML output string in 
the result. This report can be thought of as a table where 
each row is a Prediction Success Table, and each row has a 
different threshold value as generated by the &quot;start.threshold&quot;, 
&quot;end.threshold&quot;, and &quot;increment.threshold&quot; arguments. What 
is meant by a threshold here is the value above which the 
predicted probability indicates a response.<br />
Default Value: FALSE<br />
Types: logical
</p>



<h4>variance.prop.threshold</h4>

<p>Optional Argument.<br />
Specifies the variance proportion threshold value to 
use while generating near dependency report. This is 
used when &quot;near.dep.report&quot; is set to TRUE.<br />
Default Value: 0.5<br />
Types: numeric
</p>
